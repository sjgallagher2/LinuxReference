Screen is a simple program but it has a learning curve. Here's how to work it:
Type in 'screen' to start the whole thing up.
Use 'ctrl+a' and then a letter to do commands. 
To open a new window, use ctrl+a c
To go to the next window use ctrl+a n
For a specific screen, use ctrl+a and a number, like ctrl+a 2,
where the number is the screen number you want to use.
You can list all the windows by using ctrl+a w
Then split the screen left-right using ctrl+a |, or split
the screen top and bottom using ctrl+a S
Disconnect from screen with ctrl+a d, and close a window by typing
'exit' in the bash prompt.
Change from one side of the screen to the other in split screen using
ctrl+a [tab], and close split screens using ctrl+a X. Note the use of capitals
in some of these commands!
If you ever want to scroll when using multiple windows, you'll have to
use 'copy mode' by hitting ctrl+a [esc]. Get out of it with [esc].

Good luck and enjoy screen.
