A great tool for creating a program structure is UML. ArgoUML is 
free, and you can run it by cd'ing Devel/UML/argouml-0.34, then
type java -jar argouml.jar
Once you're in you can make usecase diagrams, class diagrams,
or sequence diagrams. These are the most common types. There
are obviously a shitload of diagram types (like, 11?) with
conventions so nevermind that.

The structure can seem odd. You have diagrams, which are the
actual drawings, and then you have models, which I believe
are collections of diagrams for a specific branch of the 
development process e.g. roll-out and application. The
models are all held in a project folder, which encapsulates
the entire thing.
