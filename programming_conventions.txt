HTM Conventions for Naming, Initializing, and Programming

In order to keep clean code, I'll have to define some conventions that will aid in development. First
off, initialization of variables. 

INITIALIZATION=========================================
ALL variables should have default values that will give an idea as to whether or not the variable
has been initialized in the program. 
If a variable can be initialized to 0 (e.g. permanence can be 0) it should be.
If a variable can be initialized to false, it should be.
If a variable should NOT be initialized to 0, it should be initialized to -1
Strings are initialized to ""

NAMING================================================
