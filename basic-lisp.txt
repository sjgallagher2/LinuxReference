LISP is not too similar to other languages - not ones that I know in any case. 
In order to get started programming in LISP, as opposed to just
scripting away in the terminal, you create a .lisp file with whatever
commands you want to send, and then you open clisp in another window. 
Run (load "myfile.lisp") to run every command through the command line. 
You can then compile and run things e.g. with binary by:
(compile-file "myfile.lisp")
which will create a .fas that can be used with LISP. 
Comments and commands in LISP can be found on the Learn X
in Y minutes Common Lisp page. 

Note about how lisp works: everything is a 'list', and the first part
of the list is always checked to be a function. For example,
(+ 1 2) is a common first expression. The + is the function, and
it is the first item in the list. Any time you have parens (or almost), you
need to make sure the first item is a function. 

The exceptions to this are when you have lists done via the '() macro,
and when you have function parameters defined, like
(defun hello-world () ...)
where the () is where any input parameters WOULD go.

Other symbols you see a lot are ' and # and :. They are macro characters,
denoted "single-quote", "sharpsign" and "colon". 

Good luck.
