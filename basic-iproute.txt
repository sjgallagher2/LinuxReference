iproute2 is a package of networking programs. These include:
	ip
	ss
	bridge
	rtacct
	rtmon
	tc
	ctstat
	lnstat
	nstat
	routef
	routel
	rtstat
	tipc
	arpd
	devlink
We'll be covering a few of these in this document, namely the many ip- commands that have
replaced net-tools commands. The "objects" for ip are:
	ip link				Network device
	ip address			Protocol address on a device
	ip addrlabel		Label configuration for protocol address selection
	ip route			Routing table entry
	ip rule				Rule in routing policy database
	ip neigh			Manage ARP or NDISC cache entries
	ip ntable			Manage the neighbor cache's operation
	ip tunnel			Tunnel over IP
	ip tuntap			Manage TUN/TAP devices
	ip maddress			Multicast address
	ip mroute			Multicast routing cache entry
	ip mrule			Rule in multicast routing policy database
	ip monitor			Watch for netlink messages
	ip xfrm				Manage IPSec policies
	ip netns			Manage network namespaces
	ip l2tp				Tunnel ethernet over IP
	ip tcpmetrics		Manage TCP Metrics
	ip token			Managetokenized interface identifiers
	ip macsec			MACsec device configuration

Obviously there are a bunch of these, so let's get started! A lot of this will revolve around
your wireless devices, which are something like wlp8s0, enp7s0, and lo. On an older system they might
look something like wlan0, and eth0. The former are systemd naming conventions while the latter are
simply traditional conventions. The device manager is called udev, for userspace /dev, and this will 
also come up a fair amount. 

The new naming scheme consists of two letters for a device type (wl=WLAN, en=Ethernet) followed by
a location. The p standards for PCIe, for example PCIe bus 7, and the s standards for slot.
