If you're using the command line GNUCAP, then you'll need some know-how:
Create net lists first using BUILD. Press enter when you're done. 
Type things in with SPICE syntax.
To display the output, first enable printing with:
print op stuffstuff
where 'stuffstuff' could be v(1) for the voltage at the first node, 
v(nodes) for all node voltages, v(*) for voltages at components and 
nodes both (doesn't really make sense for components), i(R1) for
the current through a component (R1 here), and i(*) for all currents. 

For example: print op v(nodes) i(*)
That'll give you good information. Then type 'op' to run the simulation.

Same thing goes for other types of analysis. You can see a reference 
manual online, or the man page from the CLI. 
Good luck.
