In order to parse the calculator's input, a simple scheme using the GNU
tools Bison and Flex is used. Flex is used for 'tokenizing' the input,
if you will. It is a lexical program that breaks the input up into
smaller pieces that can be used by the parser as tokens. 

The parser is Bison, which works with Flex in order to interpret the
tokenized input.
