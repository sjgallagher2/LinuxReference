Installing linux can be a pain, and as I find myself needing to move machines or change OSs more frequently,
I'm going to make a document explaining how to get everything working. 

INSTALLING
Start by copying all your files you want to keep from Home or var or etc or wherever. I usually just go with
home. Boot a GParted linux distro from USB, and make space for your new system. Make a USB drive with unetbootin
and make sure you add non-free/commercial drivers/firmware. The best way to do this is to find a distribution
that has the firmware already, but you can also use a firmware package and extract it into Firmware on the USB 
drive after you have already extracted the ISO to the USB drive. That should do it. 

SETTING UP LINUX
Add your user to the sudo group by going into single user mode, and adding the user to the group.
	$ su
	$ usermod -a -G sudo sam
"-a" is "append" and "-G sudo" is the group, then "sam" is the username. You'll probably still get an error about
not being in the sudoers file if you try to run sudo, so you can make absolutely sure it works by adding your
username to sudoers. Go to /etc/ and again enter single user mode. 
	$ su
	$ cd /etc
	$ visudo
"visudo" should open sudoers for editing. Add the following below "%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL":
	sam		ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
That should work for a user named "sam". 

Install all your favorite packages. Some basic packages I recommend:
	vim
	python
	python-pip
	python3
	python3-pip
	gcc-arm-none-eabi
	krusader
	texlive
	texstudio
	chromium
	pychess
	scid
	iverilog
	libgsl-dev gsl-bin
	octave (not sure if ppa is up-to-date)
	shutter
	wine

And these packages in the Downloads folder:
	google chrome
	qucs
	dia
	FreeCAD
	ArgoUML
	Visual Studio Code
	apr-1.6.2
	apr-util-1.6.0
	Eclipse
	EECalc
	ghdl
	goptical
	Matlab
	Mendeley desktop
	npgspice
	node
	openbabel
	opencascade
	stlink
	stockfish-9
	yEd
	xflux

You'll have to change a few permissions on files so that you can use them. Some executables need execution
permission, some library files need to be accessible, sometimes sweeping changes to permissions need to be made.
You can give the admin, all groups, yourself, and others (?) execution permission with:
	$ sudo chmod +x filename

Now you should set up the touchpad for your laptop by going to Settings->Mouse and Keyboard. You can also do this
by editing the xorg.conf or conf.d file or whatever, but - por que?

Other things you'll probably want to do include adding symbolic links, and adding desktop icons to binaries so
that you can see them in the "Activities" screen. 

After that's done, you'll want to get some GNOME plugins, including the one where you can move the mouse to the
left of the screen and get a dock to pop up, which I find particularly nice, called Dash to Dock.
