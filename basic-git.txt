Using github is an essential tool for version tracking, and working with open-source projects. It's very common
in the developer world.

It works in repositories, where people commit changes through pull requests. Repositories can be
forked so that they can be changed without affecting the original/master version.

To interface on your computer with github, you use Git. Here's how to set it up:
This stuff sets up your name and settings:
	git config --global user.name "JOE BLACK"
	git config --global user.email "joe.black@gmail.com"

To actually see your repos and make changes and pull requests, you can either work over:
	HTTPS, or
	SSH
When working with SSH, you need a key on your computer. Working with HTTPS is the recommended method
now. 

The important commands in Git are:
	git clone https://......			download a new repository
	git fetch ...						sync a repo
	git merge ...						merge remote branches with your own
	git pull ...						sync and merge a repository
	git push ...						push new branches to a repo

Each of these is automatically going to perform its function in whatever repository you are currently
in. The whole command will perform the given action (clone, fetch, pull, push) locally on your computer. 
Other useful commands are:
	git remote -v ...
	git remote add upstream ...

Git uses the root directory that you are in to act on commands. The root directories have .git files and such
that make it so that it knows where you are. 
For example, if you try a git command outside of a git repository, you'll get an error:
	fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /home/user)
	Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
Notice how git tried to look all the way up the file hierarchy for the git root but didn't find it. 

As an example, let's say I've found a good repo from github that I want to clone onto my local system.
For the time being, the repository is called booksmart, and is located at https://www.github.com/bob/booksmart.

To first get the repo, I call:
	$ git clone https://www.github.com/bob/booksmart
And then git will take care of it, placing a directory booksmart/ wherever I called the command. Going into
this directory, I can start working with git. A few days pass before I decide to head into the repo,
but I'm worried that I missed some updates to the code. I enter:
	$ git pull origin master
This will make sure that my branch is totally up to date. The 'origin' part represents the place
that this repo came from originally, and the 'master' refers to the master branch. 

Now I'm concerned, because there could be another branch on my system. How that could happen
without me knowing is beside the point. You can avoid any confusion with:
	$ git branch
Now I'm concerned because I'm working with this repository and I want to make some drastic
changes to the code, without affecting my master branch. So I make a new one:
	$ git branch bookdumb
Now if I run git branch I should see all my brances listed. To actually _use_ a branch that I've made,
I check it out, using the command checkout:
	$ git checkout bookdumb
But maybe I wanted to simply make the branch, then check it out. Then I use the -b flag:
	$ git check -b bookdumb
In this way, I could cut down the two commands into one. But now, it's time to get rid of that branch,
because it was no good in the end. I can merge, or simply delete the branch like this:
	$ git branch -D bookdumb
This will _force_ the deletion of the branch, regardless of whether I have merged it or not. If I want
to avoid destroying my work without merging, I can use
	$ git branch -d bookdumb
instead. There is a lot to the whole 'git' thing. I suggest reading the "Git User Manual" from kernel.org.

If you want to check back in time, to a certain 'release' of a project, you can set tags as you go, and
refer back to them whenever you want. Tags are usually labelled in versions, such as V2.0.1 or 
simply 3.2.3. To access and create tags, use
	$ git tag
You can then checkout these versions, as opposed to different branches. The branches you create have a 
"head", which is the version of the project that your branch jumps off of. 

Sometimes you want to simply visualize all the different changes over time, instead of working with
git internally. To do that, you use:
	$ gitk
This is a visual git program that runs with KDE (or GTK, not sure)

Finally, software is typically released as a .tar.gz file, which is a zip format. To make a release using
one of the versions of your project as a .tar.gz, you can run:
	$ git archive -o booksmart1.5.7.tar.gz master
or
	$ git archive -o booksmart1.5.7.tar.gz --prefix=booksmart/ master
Which will put all the files in another folder called "booksmart" which acts like the big owner of
everything. Other good things to do are to make change logs, which show how the project has changed.

Happy git-ing.
